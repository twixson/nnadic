# nnadic

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of nnadic (Neural Network for Asymptotic Dependence/Independence Classification) is to classify bivariate data sets as either asymptotically dependent or independent using a trained convolutional neural network. The tool *will be* set up to automatically: 
  * transform the marginal distribution
  * take the top 5% of the data (using the $l_\infty$-norm)
  * resample or subsample as necessary to ensure the data is of the correct dimension 
  * output the predicted result from the neural network 
There *will be* many customization options which allow the user to take advantage of advanced functionality. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of nnadic from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("twixson/nnadic")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(nnadic)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
